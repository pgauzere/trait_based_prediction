This repository containd the supporting code for the paper "Trait-based prediction and control: a roadmap for community ecology"

It will allow you to play with the trait x environment based predictions of model parameters, and predict coexistence outcome, network features, invasibility and response to environmental changes. 

Please begin with "code_use_paper_figures.R" to reproduce the simulations presented in the paper ( and more ). 
All details of how to use the different functions are present in the foreword of each functions. 

If you have any issues, you can contact me via github or email [pierre.gauzere@gmail.com]

Thanks
